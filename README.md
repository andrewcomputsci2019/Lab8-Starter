## Graceful Degradation

Graceful Degradation and service workers are related as service workers provide an avenue of applying another layer of Graceful degradation to a web page. For example service workers can cache important features of your webpage to allow users to use during internet outages or other intermediate network loss events. This also works both ways where if your website goes down some users with cached content from before may still be able to use the website within some limited form. This is inlined with the idealogy of graceful degradation as it allows for a website to work with limited functionality instead of completing failing out right.
